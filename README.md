# Build

## What is Build and Package Management Tools
Whenever the Developers write a code using the languages they prefer such as (JAVA/NodeJS/Golang/Python), they can run directly on the local machine, using the code
they developed, But if we want to run our developed code on the the different machines and different OS, we basically have to install all the dependicuies again, on the new machine and lots of work. to solve this one, every language have the build tools which compiles and compress and package all the dependecnies in to one single binary file(i.e .exe,deb/rpm, jar,..) so that we can deploy this one single file. 

NOTE: Build Once and Deploy Many times.
